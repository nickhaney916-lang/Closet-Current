# Closet Current progress checkpoint

Paused at the owner's request on October 14, 2026, 7:44 AM America/Los_Angeles.

## Current saved state

- Repository: nickhaney916-lang/Closet-Current; production branch: main.
- Application source at pause: `686f88679b00678527c98569d1b09be8dcd96d04`.
- Live app: https://closet-current.pages.dev/
- Phone photo check: https://closet-current.pages.dev/phone-photo-check.html
- The photo-check page returned HTTP 200 and matched the built release identifier and recognition-vector digest.
- Simplified navigation and high-resolution camera functionality are preserved. Drive Duel was not accessed or modified.

## Recognition work completed

- Verified rollback camera/indexing tests passed.
- Full-garment preprocessing improved the original 32-photo category result from 19/32 to 23/32 and shoes from 8/13 to 11/13.
- The later validated prompt profile reached 26/32 categories, including 12/13 shoes; 7/13 categories on additional garments; and 10/11 categories on fresh photographs.
- Per-photo regression enforcement protects all 59 fixtures, including three nonclothing images. Known annotated subtype mismatches remain explicitly visible.
- Eight subsequent subtype/recovery candidates were evaluated. None safely improved recognition, so the production model, vectors, confidence gates and preprocessing were retained. Detailed metrics and rejected changes are preserved in docs/SUBTYPE-RECOGNITION-RESULTS.md and benchmark/subtype-experiment-results.json.

## Latest completed delivery

Optional phone-photo validation is deployed and linked from My account → Device help.

- Supports up to 20 single-garment photos with independently supplied category labels and optional type labels.
- Locks expected labels before inference, uses the production local worker and the app's photo-import conversion, and does not save wardrobe items.
- Downloads a report with safe labels, rejection diagnostics, timings and version identifiers. Images, filenames and account information are excluded; nothing is sent automatically.
- Handles scanner timeouts, partial failures and restarting the test.
- All 166 automated tests passed.
- Real-worker phone photo-check flow, camera/indexing tests, mobile capture/persistence flow, Cloudflare deployment and GitHub Pages deployment passed.
- Browser tests use licensed fixtures at a phone viewport; physical phone hardware and new user garment accuracy remain unverified.

## Exact next step when resuming

Collect real phone evidence before further recognition tuning:

1. Open the phone photo check and choose 5–10 different garment photos, including dresses, long tops, sneakers and boots.
2. Supply expected labels before running recognition. Leave the optional subtype blank when uncertain.
3. Download closet-phone-photo-results.json and attach it to the development conversation.
4. Analyze mismatches and error stages. Request only the particular numbered garment images needed for visual investigation, then test targeted changes against the phone evidence and existing 59-photo safeguards.

The prior uploads inspected were setup screenshots, so no user phone garment dataset or new phone accuracy claim has been established. See docs/PHONE-PHOTO-VALIDATION.md for the collection workflow and evidence.

## Other open priorities

Physical-phone capture/login validation, reliable authentication email delivery, cloud wardrobe backup/synchronization and eventual subscription readiness remain open as documented in docs/ROADMAP.md. They have not been completed by these recognition tasks.

Development is paused. No further product changes are requested until the owner resumes.
